Programming music for 4klang using Javascript
=============================================

[4klang](https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang/) is a tiny but powerful synthesizer written for making music to fit in 4KB demos. When exporting a song using the VSTi the result is a `4klang.inc` and `4klang.asm` file to be assembled with [yasm](https://yasm.tortall.net/), and this project export the very same files, but instead they are generated by writing your song in Javascript.

The Javascript api contains simple functions for creating patterns and playing notes, and you can use your programming skills to create loops, generate fancy patterns or whatever.

You'll find example songs in [songs](songs) folder. So if you e.g. want to test the song [groove is in the code](songs/grooveisinthecode.inc.js), you just symlink it to `4klang.inc.js` in this directory.

The [run.sh](run.sh) script is currently tuned for Mac OSX, and there's another [runlinux.sh](runlinux.sh) that works for Linux. It will use nodejs to generate `4klang.inc` which then will be assembled with [4klang.asm](4klang.asm) to create an object file to be linked with [4klangrender.c](4klangrender.c) which will create an executable that creates raw audio data. By piping it into [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) you'll get audio output or you can generate a wav file.

Here's the generated audio output from the example song [Groove is in the code](https://soundcloud.com/psalomo/groove-is-in-the-code-4klang-mix)
