Music written in Javascript
===========================

This is work in progress, but you can see a demo here:

And you can listen to the song [songs/upbeat.js](songs/upbeat.js) here: 
https://soundcloud.com/psalomo/80s-nostalgica

Run directly from nodejs, only dependes on the node midi package, and connect to a midi device.

For the sounds [ZynAddSubFX](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/) was used.


More stuff coming soon....
