Music written in Javascript
===========================

This is work in progress, but you can see a demo here:

And you can listen to the song [songs/upbeat.js](songs/upbeat.js) here: 
https://soundcloud.com/psalomo/80s-nostalgica

Run directly from nodejs, only dependes on the node midi package, and connect to a midi device.

For the sounds [ZynAddSubFX](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/) was used.


## 4klang

My experiments with the [4klang](https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang/) synth can be found int the [4klang](4klang) folder.

If you just want to listen to the songs:

## Webassembly music experiments

Also experimenting with synthesizing music in webassembly using AssemblyScript in the [wasmaudioworklet/synth1](wasmaudioworklet/synth1) folder.

You can see a live demo here (currently only working in Google chrome):
